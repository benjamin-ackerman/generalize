##### Function Ideas: #####

# 1: Trim target population to match covariate bounds of trial
# 2: Calculate trial participation probabilities using
      # GLM
      # Random Forests
      # Super Learner?
      # Lasso
      # others?
# 3: Compare distributions of trial participation probabilities using
      # Tipton generalizability index
      # Kolmogorov-Smirnov?
      # others?
# 4: Create plots (?)
      # Covariate difference b/w trial and population pre-and-post weighting
      # Plot trial participation probabilities
      # Plot SATE and TATE, show difference between the two
# 5: Generalize results using
      # Weighting by the odds
      # Weighting by the inverse probability (?)
      # BART
      # TMLE
